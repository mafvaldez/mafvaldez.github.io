					<p>People call me Maria or Jelai, depending on the social circle. I am currently studying Computer Science in the University of the Philippines Los Banos. I came from Pasig City but is a full-bred Batangueno. My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 130 because somehow I felt validated when I took that subject. As for my favorite GE class, it would have to be SPCM 1 because I have made amazing friends that I can lean on even up to this date. I don't have a favorite PL but if I have to choose it would be C because I am used to its syntax. I love eating pizza and chicken wings when I'm stressed. I love sleeping and watching random YouTube videos. I have always wanted to be an engineer, but here I am in ComSci (yikes).</p>
